# Webpage generator for the student association Blindern Rockeswing

Created using the [Plot](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Plot) html generation framework. *Needs a swift environment in order build html files.*

The user needs to add a python file with login credentials in order to upload using the `Deploy.py` script. Example of a `credentials.py` file:

```python
password = "password"
host = "ssh.website/to/upload.to"
user = "website/to/upload.to"
port = 42
```
